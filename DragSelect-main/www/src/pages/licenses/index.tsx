            DragSelect is, and will forever be, a free and open-source tool.{" "}
            <strong>Free for any non-commercial project</strong>. However, this
            is a lot of work and hard work should be rewarded, so if you are
            using DragSelect for business and/or commercial sites, projects, and
            applications youâ€™ll have to get the commercial license to keep your
            source proprietary and the project alive.

          startup license includes 5 team members: this means you buy one
          startup license per 5 team members. The enterprise license however has
          no limits: this means you only buy the enterprise license once no
          matter how big your company is.
